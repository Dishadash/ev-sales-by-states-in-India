# ev-sales-by-states-in-India
Electric vehicles (EVs) are a growing sector in India, with adoption varying significantly across states. This project analyzes state-wise EV sales data to uncover adoption trends by vehicle type, class, and year. Using Python, &amp; Tableau, I transformed raw data into insights that can guide business decisions and policy planning.
Statement:
India's EV adoption is not consistent, therefore companies and governments must know which states and car models are driving the most growth. This project's objective was to examine EV sales by state and identify trends by year, car type, and category. 
Tools & Techniques:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) 
EDA : Exploratory Data Analysis
Statistics : Distribution, correlation, skewness, kurtosis
Tableau : Dashboards (donut, map, network, line chart, etc)                             
Steps Taken:
1. Data Cleaning - Handled missing values, standardized state names, and fixed date format.
2. Statistical Analysis  - Density charts, skewness, kurtosis, correlation, mean, and median
3. Tableau Dashboards - Network (state â†” vehicle type), line chart (growth), map (by state), and donut (by vehicle type), etc.
ðŸ‘‰ Results
Top states: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka lead EV adoption
Categories: 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers dominate sales, while 4-wheelers and buses are growing gradually
Yearly trend: Consistent growth in EV sales, with spikes in recent years
ðŸ”‘ Insights
- EV adoption is concentrated in a few states, showing large regional disparities
- Uttar Pradesh has a strong tie with E-rickshaws, while southern states like Tamil Nadu push 4-wheelers
- Policy & infrastructure expansion in lagging states can accelerate nationwide adoption
- Businesses can target 2W and 3W segments for immediate growth, while preparing for the future 4W market.
